Don't lock me out
=================

Don't lock me out is a simple script that will prevent a windows user from
being locked out due to inactivity.
It simulates mouse movement by moving mouse to the right every 4:58 minutes.

I made it for my colleague who can't change her Windows settings because it is a
corporate computer.
She uses it when working from home and user lockout is annoying her.

I compiled it with http://www.pyinstaller.org/ for user friendly executable.
